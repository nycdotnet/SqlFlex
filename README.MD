SqlFlex
=======

A tool to help developers work efficiently with relational databases.  Descendent of [TSQL-Flex](https://github.com/nycdotnet/TSqlFlex).

### Current status:
Pre-alpha.  No useful features yet.

Has a working WPF connect dialog and can connect to Postgres using the Npgsql library and run queries returning only the simplest data types (returned in a bad CSV format).  Runs on Windows and Mac; should run on Linux, but untested.
